FailedToCreateBasicComponent Exception
CircularHierarchy Exception
NotImplementedError for current tcl error handling

AdjustmentStrategies.
OBS: Note that the current high level component architecture creates and updates basic components when a new parent is set, the adjustment strategy will then be also a factor
for creating and updating basic components, only setting the parent is not enough, you also have to set a strategy for the basic components to be created.

Create proper BasicComponents and HighLevelComponents, and add new ones like a Listbox BasicComponent or a ScrolledText BasicComponent and a VLCVideo HighLevelComponent.
